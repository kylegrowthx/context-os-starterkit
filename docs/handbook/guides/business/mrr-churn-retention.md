# MRR, churn, and retention

## The Core Insight

Your company will stop growing sooner than you think. Not because of market size—but because of **churn math**.

Most founders operate with dangerous misconceptions:
- "7% cancellation is fine, especially for consumer businesses."
- "As long as I keep adding \$300/mo of new MRR, I'll build a real business."
- "I'll keep scaling past a few million in ARR by doing what I've always done."

**Max MRR** is the metric that cuts through these illusions. It's predictive, updates monthly, and tells you exactly where your revenue ceiling is.

---

## Part 1: The Max MRR Framework

### What Is Max MRR?

Max MRR is the mathematical ceiling your business will hit based on two inputs:
1. **New MRR** (monthly revenue from new customers, upgrades, and reactivations)
2. **Monthly Cancellation Rate** (percentage of existing revenue that churns each month)

**The Formula:**

```
Max MRR = New MRR / Cancellation Rate
```

**Example:** If you add \$1,000 in new MRR monthly and have 5% monthly churn:
- Max MRR = \$1,000 / 0.05 = **\$20,000**
- Your business will level off around \$20k MRR—no matter how long you run it

### Why Growth Stops

New MRR is constant. Cancellation is **proportional** to your customer base.

As you grow:
- More customers = more absolute churn dollars
- Eventually, churn dollars match new dollars
- Growth stops completely

This explains why fast initial growth tapers off sooner than founders expect.

### The Buffer Case Study

Jason Cohen analyzed Buffer's public financials as a case study:

| Timeframe | What Happened | Max MRR Insight |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2012-2014 | Found PMF, cancellations dropped 8%→6%, new MRR accelerated | Max MRR shot up |
| 2014-2020 | Cancellations stuck at 6%, but kept accelerating new MRR | Linear growth only (no acceleration) |
| 2020-2024 | Cancellation popped to 7%, revenue declined | Max MRR dipped below actual MRR |
| 2024+ | New strategy, cancellation improved to 6%, new MRR increased | Max MRR shot back up, growth reignited |

**Key insight:** During stagnation, Buffer had *more* new customers than ever—but also *more* cancellations. The Max MRR metric predicted this months in advance.

### Max MRR as a Leading Indicator

- **Current MRR** = lagging indicator (tells you what happened)
- **Max MRR** = leading indicator (tells you what's coming)

When cancellation rate improves even slightly, Max MRR shoots up immediately—while actual revenue takes time to catch up. This gives you early warning and early confirmation of strategic changes.

---

## Part 2: The Math of Churn

### Small Changes, Massive Impact

Cancellation is **exponential**—small changes compound dramatically.

| Monthly Churn | Max MRR Multiplier |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 7% | New MRR × 14.3 |
| 6% | New MRR × 16.7 |
| 5% | New MRR × 20.0 |
| 4% | New MRR × 25.0 |
| 3% | New MRR × 33.3 |

**Example:** If Buffer had improved from 8% to 3% churn (a 5 percentage point improvement), their revenue would have **doubled**.

### The New MRR Trap

Founders think accelerating new MRR solves growth problems. It doesn't—because churn acceleration cancels out new MRR acceleration.

Even companies with accelerating marketing output typically grow revenue **linearly**, not exponentially. You can't outrun churn with more sales.

### When Max MRR Becomes Meaningless

If your **Net Revenue Retention (NRR) ≥ 100%**, Max MRR loses meaning. You're no longer constrained by churn—you'd grow forever (until market saturation).

This is why **almost all public SaaS companies have NRR ≥ 100%** at IPO:
- Average NRR at IPO: 119%
- All were above 100%
- Average ARR at IPO: \$255M

For solopreneurs: NRR creates growth even with limited marketing budget. Build expansion into your model.

## Part 3: Strategic vs Tactical Retention

Patrick Campbell (ProfitWell founder) made this distinction clear:

### Strategic Retention (Product-focused)

This is what most product teams obsess over:
- ICP definition
- Time to value optimization
- Roadmapping right features
- Mission metrics
- Paper cuts in the experience

### Tactical Retention (Operations-focused)

This is what product teams **ignore**—yet it's **25-40% of your churn problem**:
- Payment failures
- Term optimization
- Cancellation flows
- Offboarding experience

**Patrick's insight:** "If you're past product-market fit, tactical retention is typically 25-40% of your churn problem—but you don't look at it because you're focused on features."

### The Cancellation Flow Opportunity

ProfitWell studied **2 million cancellation flows**:

**Key findings:**
- You have 18-30 seconds when someone hits "cancel"
- Ask exactly **two questions:**
  1. "Why are you leaving?" (multiple choice—not free response)
  2. "What did you like about the product?"

**Why the second question works:** It taps into nostalgia and stops the "freight train" mentality. The customer was determined to cancel—asking what they liked interrupts that momentum.

Then, based on their answers + engagement data + firmographics, offer:
- A salvage offer
- A pause plan
- A maintenance plan

### Products That Retain Best

Two types of products retain exceptionally well:
1. **Workflow products** used every single day
2. **Anti-active usage products** that deliver value without logging in

Everything in the middle has "death retention"—users don't use it enough to love it, but it's not automatic enough to justify the cost.

---

## Part 4: Retention Frameworks from Practitioners

### Elena Verna's Growth Loops Perspective

Retention isn't about preventing churn—it's about building **earned acquisition channels** that compound:

- Virality
- Word of mouth
- User-generated content

These create "gifts that keep giving." No one can take them from you.

**Warning:** If your growth plan is "paid acquisition + freemium + hope people stick around," pivot now. Consumer subscription is brutally hard:
- Need 60-70%+ annual retention
- Companies achieving this: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Duolingo
- They do it through massive OPEX, economies of scale, or network effects

### Gibson Biddle's Netflix Framework

**Delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways.**

Netflix measures delight through **retention:**
- 2005: ~10% cancelled monthly
- 2005 (when Gib joined): ~4.5% cancelled monthly
- Today: ~2% cancel monthly

**The Perfect New Release Test:**
- Hypothesis: Getting new releases faster would dramatically improve retention
- Reality: Retention improved from 4.5% to 4.45%—a tiny change
- Math: Worth ~\$1M in value but cost \$5M in inventory
- Decision: Don't roll out

**Framework for trade-offs:**
- Improved retention × Lifetime value × Word of mouth factor = Value created
- Compare to cost to deliver

### Casey Winters on Consumer Subscription

Consumer subscriptions lack the two great attributes of B2B SaaS:
1. Customers are less predictable (not rational like businesses)
2. No net dollar retention—year 2 revenue = year 1 revenue

**Result:** You need higher user-based retention than B2B SaaS with more unpredictable users.

**The Blue Apron Warning:**
- Raised \$300M in an IPO valued at \$2B
- Worth \$50M today
- Paid acquisition got worse as they scaled (targeting best customers first)
- No network effects to offset declining acquisition quality

## Part 5: Mental Models for Churn

### Model 1: The Revenue Ceiling

Think of Max MRR as your revenue ceiling. Your job is to:
1. Raise the ceiling (reduce churn)
2. Fill the room faster (increase new MRR)
3. Eventually break through the ceiling (achieve NRR ≥ 100%)

### Model 2: The Leaky Bucket

New MRR fills the bucket. Churn is the hole.
- A bigger hole doesn't mean you need more water—it means you need a smaller hole.
- Filling faster without fixing the hole is unsustainable.

### Model 3: Strategic vs Tactical Split

Allocate retention work:
- 70-80% strategic (product improvements)
- 20-30% tactical (payment failures, cancellation flows)

If you're doing 100% strategic, you're leaving money on the table.

### Model 4: The Two Types of Customers

From retention data analysis:
1. **High-intent churners:** Made up their mind, nothing will save them
2. **Salvageable churners:** Open to being saved with the right offer

Your job is to identify and rescue the second group—not waste resources on the first.

### Model 5: Usage Patterns Predict Churn

Gibson Biddle's insight: Features used by less than 2% of customers should be killed ("scraping the barnacles").

Low-usage features:
- Create complexity for everyone
- Get forgotten by engineering (broken in updates)
- Don't improve retention

If something only 2% use, it's not worth the complexity cost.

## Part 6: The Retention Playbook

### Immediate Actions (Tactical)

1. **Audit your payment failure flow**
   - How many customers are you losing to failed credit cards?
   - Implement dunning sequences (pre-expiration warnings, retry logic)

2. **Fix your cancellation flow**
   - Two questions: Why leaving? What did you like?
   - Offer pause, downgrade, or salvage options

3. **Check your term optimization**
   - Annual prepay creates commitment
   - Monthly creates optionality for the customer (bad for you)

### Medium-term Actions (Strategic)

4. **Define your retention proxy metric**
   - What behavior predicts long-term retention?
   - Netflix: watching hours
   - Slack: messages sent
   - Your product: ???

5. **Identify your "aha moment"**
   - What must a customer experience to become retained?
   - How quickly can you get them there?

6. **Build expansion into the product**
   - Value metrics that grow with usage
   - Upgrade paths that feel natural

### Long-term Actions (Structural)

7. **Aim for NRR ≥ 100%**
   - Expansion must exceed churn
   - This breaks the Max MRR ceiling

8. **Build earned channels**
   - Virality
   - User-generated content
   - Word of mouth
   - These compound; paid acquisition doesn't

9. **Consider your pricing metric**
   - Per-user, per-usage pricing reduces churn 20-25%
   - Customers downgrade instead of cancel
   - Expansion becomes automatic

## Part 7: Metrics Dashboard

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Max MRR | New MRR / Monthly Churn Rate | Increasing quarter-over-quarter |
| Monthly Churn | Cancelled MRR / Starting MRR | &lt; 3% for SaaS |
| NRR | (Starting MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting MRR | ≥ 100% |
| Quick Ratio | (New MRR + Expansion) / (Churn + Downgrade) | 3-4 early stage, 1.5-2 at scale |

### Secondary Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Revenue per Customer | Pricing power + expansion health |
| Payment Failure Rate | Tactical retention opportunity |
| Voluntary vs Involuntary Churn Split | Where to focus efforts |
| Time to Value | Activation quality |
| Feature Usage Distribution | What's driving retention |

## Part 8: Common Churn Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating All Churn the Same

Churn has different causes requiring different solutions:
- **Price churn:** Need better value demonstration or pricing
- **Competitor churn:** Need differentiation
- **Feature churn:** Need product improvements
- **Non-use churn:** Need better activation/engagement
- **Payment churn:** Need better dunning

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Tactical Retention

25-40% of churn is tactical—yet most teams spend 0% of their time on it. Finance teams should own this.

### Mistake 3: Over-investing in New MRR

New MRR acceleration doesn't compound—churn cancels it out. A 1 percentage point improvement in churn rate is often worth more than 2x-ing marketing spend.

### Mistake 4: Waiting for Churn to Fix Itself

"When we have more features, churn will improve." Wrong. Churn is structural. If you have 7% churn today, you'll have 7% churn with more features unless you directly address retention.

### Mistake 5: Not Tracking Max MRR

If you don't know your Max MRR, you don't know your ceiling. You might be 80% of the way to your maximum possible revenue and not realize it.

## Part 9: Industry Benchmarks

### SaaS Monthly Churn by Stage

| Stage | Good | Great |
|-------|------|-------|
| Seed/Series A | &lt; 5% | &lt; 3% |
| Series B+ | &lt; 3% | &lt; 2% |
| Public Company | &lt; 2% | &lt; 1% |

### Consumer Subscription Annual Retention

| Quality | Annual Retention |
|---------|------------------|
| Struggling | &lt; 40% |
| Surviving | 40-60% |
| Thriving | 60-70%+ |

### NRR Benchmarks

| Quality | NRR |
|---------|-----|
| Below average | &lt; 100% |
| Good | 100-110% |
| Great | 110-130% |
| Elite | 130%+ |

## Part 10: Summary

### The Bottom Line

1. **Know your ceiling.** Calculate your Max MRR today. Are you approaching it?

2. **Churn is exponential.** Small improvements compound dramatically. A 2 percentage point improvement can double your business.

3. **NRR is the escape hatch.** Get to 100%+ NRR and Max MRR no longer constrains you.

4. **Tactical retention is free money.** 25-40% of churn is fixable without product changes.

5. **Retention beats acquisition.** It's cheaper to keep a customer than find a new one—and reducing churn improves Max MRR directly.

### Your Next Step

Calculate your Max MRR right now:
```
Max MRR = Last Month's New MRR / Monthly Churn Rate
```

If it's less than 2x your current MRR, you have a churn problem that no amount of growth can solve.
