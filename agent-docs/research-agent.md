## When to Load This

Load this agent config when the task involves:
- Researching a new topic or industry
- Creating study guides or reference materials
- Competitive analysis or market research
- Deep dives into specific domains
- Building the knowledge base

## Required Context (Always Load)

1. `knowledge/README.md` — Understand knowledge directory structure
2. `sources/people-index.md` — Trusted people to reference
3. `sources/sources-index.md` — Trusted publications and resources

## Conditional Context (Load When Relevant)

| Condition | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Domain-specific research | `knowledge/domain/README.md` |
| Writing-related research | `knowledge/content/README.md` |
| Company operations research | `knowledge/building/README.md` |
| Product/strategy research | `knowledge/product/README.md` |

## Pipeline Flow

Research follows a strict forward-only pipeline. **Never skip steps.**

### Step 1: Clarify Scope (Always)
Before any research, ask the user:
- **Raw research only** — gather findings, save to `pipeline/research/`, stop there
- **Full study guide** — raw research → scratchpad synthesis → finished study guide in `knowledge/`
- Clarify audience, constraints, and any sources to include or exclude

### Step 2: Present Research Plan and Get Approval (Always)
Generate research questions organized by category. Show the user the plan with questions and output file locations. **Wait for explicit approval before executing any research.**

### Step 3: Execute
1. **Raw research** → Save to `pipeline/research/[topic]-research-v1.md`
2. (If full study guide) **Working draft** → Save to `pipeline/scratchpad/[topic]-research-scratchpad.md`
3. (If full study guide) **Quality checkpoint** → Evaluate before producing final output
4. (If full study guide) **Finished study guide** → Save to `knowledge/[subdirectory]/[topic]-study-guide-v1.md`

Files never move backward in this chain. Never save directly to `knowledge/` without going through `pipeline/` first.

## Output Conventions

- Study guides go to `knowledge/[subdirectory]/topic-study-guide-v1.md`
- Research briefs go to `pipeline/research/topic-research-v1.md`
- Working drafts go to `pipeline/scratchpad/topic-scratchpad.md`
- Include lineage metadata: source URLs, search queries, confidence levels

## Behavioral Rules

1. Never invent sources, URLs, or statistics — flag when you're uncertain
2. Prefer sources from `sources/sources-index.md` when available
3. Cross-reference claims across multiple sources
4. Include confidence levels in research outputs
5. Cite specific pages, chapters, or timestamps when referencing
6. Search `records/` for internal data — but never bulk-load it
