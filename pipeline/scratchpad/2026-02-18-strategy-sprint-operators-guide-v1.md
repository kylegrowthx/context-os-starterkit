## TL;DR

- **EMs own the relationship.** You're accountable for conversion, renewals, and expansion.
- **MEs own quality.** Production, editing, pipeline improvement.
- **Directors are leverage.** Strategy, escalations, training.
- **System mindset:** Every week serving the same client should get easier.
- **Proactive > Reactive:** The best EMs surface issues before clients do.

## Part 1: Role Clarity

### Who Does What

| Role | Primary Accountability | Key Activities |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Engagement Manager (EM)** | Client relationship, conversion, renewals | Strategy, communication, stakeholder management |
| **Managing Editor (ME)** | Output quality, pipeline improvement | Content production, QA, feedback integration |
| **Director** | Strategy quality, escalation support | Complex strategy, training, senior oversight |
| **Forward-Deployed Engineer (FDE)** | AI workflow customization | Pipeline setup, technical implementation |

### The EM is the Driver

EMs are ultimately responsible for the end-to-end client relationship. They're part:
- Customer success
- Strategist
- Growth marketer
- Sales
- Editor

**What good looks like:**
- Customers view them as the best hire they've ever made
- Proactive, not reactive
- Building relationships across the customer's organization
- Driving outcomes, not just managing output

### Ownership Matrix

| Task | EM | ME | Director | FDE |
|------|----|----|----------|-----|
| Client communication | **Own** | Support | Escalation | — |
| Strategy development | **Own** | Input | Review | — |
| Artifact generation | Oversee | **Own** | — | Support |
| Content production | Monitor | **Own** | — | — |
| Quality bar | Define | **Own** | Escalation | — |
| Pipeline setup | Request | — | — | **Own** |
| Feedback integration | Capture | **Own** | — | Support |
| Escalations | Flag | Flag | **Own** | — |
| Renewals | **Own** | Support | Support | — |

## Part 2: The Editorial System

### Quality Ownership

**The Quality Bar:**
- EM defines what "good" looks like for this client
- ME enforces it on every piece
- If unclear → calibrate together
- If impossible → escalate to Director

**Final QA:**
- ME runs the quality checklist before anything reaches the client
- EM reviews for strategic alignment
- Client should never see obvious errors

### Client Feedback Capture

**When client gives feedback:**

1. **EM captures it** — document exactly what they said
2. **EM translates it** — turn vague feedback into actionable changes
3. **EM shares with ME** — ensure ME understands the "why"
4. **ME implements** — update artifacts, pipeline, or instructions
5. **EM confirms** — verify the fix worked in next output

**The feedback loop must be tight.** Days, not weeks.

### Learnings → Pipeline

Every piece of feedback should improve the system:

| Feedback Type | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Voice/tone issue | Update writing_guidelines artifact |
| Factual error | Update products_services artifact |
| Structural preference | Update proofreader_checklist |
| Recurring edit | Create automation or add to QA checklist |
| One-off fix | Just fix it, don't systematize |

**The system mindset:** If you're making the same edit twice, something is broken upstream.

## Part 4: Client Communication

### Communication Rhythm

| Touchpoint | Frequency | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Weekly update | Every Friday | Status, progress, next steps |
| Weekly sync call | Weekly | Relationship, alignment, blockers |
| Async Slack | As needed | Quick questions, approvals |
| Monthly check-in | Monthly | Satisfaction, feedback |
| Quarterly QBR | Quarterly | Performance review, renewal |

### The Magic Drip Campaign

**Proactively share insights that are relevant and interesting to the client.**

This isn't about status updates. It's about demonstrating expertise and building trust.

**Examples:**
- "Saw this article about [their industry]. Thought you'd find it interesting."
- "Your competitor just published [X]. Here's what we can learn from it."
- "Early signal: [Topic] is starting to trend. Should we prioritize?"
- "Noticed [metric] improved this week. Here's why I think that happened."

**Frequency:** At least 1x per week beyond required updates.

### Explaining Quality Improvements

Clients should understand what's changing and why:

**Template:**
```
This week we made several improvements to your content pipeline:

**What changed:**
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]

**Why:**
Based on your feedback about [X], we adjusted [Y].

**What you'll see:**
Going forward, content will [specific improvement].

Let me know if you have questions.
```

## Part 5: Health Scoring System

### The Five Dimensions

Every account is scored 1-5 on five dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | What "Good" Looks Like |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Output** | Are we doing the work? | Content shipping on time |
| **Quality** | Is the work good? | Minimal revisions, positive feedback |
| **Performance** | Is it working? | Traffic growing, visibility improving |
| **Relationship** | Do they love us? | Expanding scope, referring others |
| **Strategy** | Are we aligned? | Clear direction, executive buy-in |

### Health Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | What It Means |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Strong** | 20+ total AND no dimension below 4 | Renewal likely. Referenceable. Low-touch. |
| **Healthy** | 18+ total AND no dimension below 3 | Solid. Minor issues. Monitor quarterly. |
| **At Risk** | 15+ total OR any dimension at 2 | Needs attention. Active intervention required. |
| **Critical** | <15 total OR any dimension at 1 | High churn risk. Escalate immediately. |

### Sprint Health by Week

## Part 6: Expected Behaviors

### What Great EMs Do

**Proactive Communication:**
- Share updates before clients ask
- Flag risks before they become problems
- Send the Magic Drip insights weekly

**Relationship Building:**
- Know the org chart — who's the champion? The skeptic? The signer?
- Build relationships across the org, not just with your POC
- Make the client feel heard and understood

**Strategic Thinking:**
- Connect deliverables to business outcomes
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Push back on bad ideas (respectfully)

**Accountability:**
- Own mistakes, don't hide them
- Escalate early, not late
- Follow through on every commitment

### What Great MEs Do

**System Thinking:**
- Find failure modes and fix them upstream
- Every week should get easier, not harder
- Document patterns for future accounts

**Quality Obsession:**
- Never ship work you wouldn't be proud of
- Catch issues before clients do
- Continuously raise the bar

**Feedback Integration:**
- Translate vague feedback into actionable changes
- Update artifacts immediately, not "later"
- Close the loop with EM

### Production Pacing

**Editors should be producing content weeks ahead. Never producing content the week it's due.**

If you're scrambling week-of, something is broken.

## Part 7: Client Expectations

### What We Tell Clients

**During Sprint:**
- We move fast but thoughtfully
- Feedback is essential — be specific and timely
- We'll adapt based on what we learn
- Week 6 is the decision point

**About Quality:**
- AI does 80-90% of the work
- Experts ensure quality and strategic alignment
- The system gets smarter over time
- Feedback improves everything

**About Results:**
- SEO takes time — 3-6 months for meaningful impact
- Early signals (indexation, impressions) come faster
- We track leading indicators, not just lagging ones
- Content is a compounding investment

### What Clients Should Expect

**From Us:**
- Weekly updates every Friday
- Responsive communication (24-48 hours)
- Proactive insights, not just status
- Transparency about challenges

**From Themselves:**
- Timely feedback (within 1 week)
- Engaged stakeholders
- Clear approval authority
- Access to systems and context

---

## Part 8: The System Mindset

### The Core Principle

**We are not a content factory where humans do the same manual work every week. We are building a system.**

Every edit you make should feed back into the system.
Every failure mode you find should get fixed upstream.
Every week should be easier than the last for the same client.

If you're doing the same fix repeatedly, escalate it. That's a pipeline problem, not a content problem.

### When We Get This Right

- Capacity increases without adding headcount
- Quality stays consistent or improves
- Clients get more value
- Margins improve

### When We Get This Wrong

- Every client feels like starting from scratch
- Editors burn out
- Quality is inconsistent
- We can't scale
