# GrowthX Writing

Write like a smart friend explaining something important. Direct, clear, real.

## Inputs / Outputs

| | What | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Input** | Topic, draft, or content brief from user | "Write a LinkedIn post about AEO" |
| **Context** | `context/voice/writing-style-context-v2.md` (always load) | -- |
| **Context** | `context/personal/marcel-linkedin-style-guide-v1.md` (if LinkedIn) | -- |
| **Context** | Relevant `docs/` files for subject matter | `docs/products/checkthat/` for CheckThat content |
| **Output** | Finished content or review with flags | Delivered inline or saved to `pipeline/outputs/` |

## Quick Start

1. Read the style guide: [writing-style-context-v2.md](../../context/voice/writing-style-context-v2.md)
2. Apply these essentials:
   - Lead with the point (main idea in first two sentences)
   - Maximum clarity, minimum words
   - Write like you talk
   - Ground in specifics (numbers, examples, stories)

## Writing Workflow

### Creating Content

1. **Draft fast** — Get ideas out. Quality comes later
2. **Structure** — Lead > Decompose > Connect > Summarize
3. **Rewrite** — Cut 50% on first pass. Every sentence earns its place
4. **Quality check** — Run the tests below

### Reviewing Content

Flag issues using:
- 🔴 **Must fix**: Buried lead, jargon, passive voice, abstractions
- 🟡 **Improve**: Verbose, weak verbs, missing specifics
- 🟢 **Optional**: Style polish, tighter phrasing

## Quality Checks

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] Main point in first two sentences?
- [ ] Would you say this to a friend?
- [ ] Can you cut 20% without losing meaning?
- [ ] Concrete details instead of abstractions?
- [ ] Active voice throughout?

## Voice Essentials

**Channel these writers:**
- Paul Graham — Conversational precision
- Naval — Compressed wisdom
- Derek Sivers — Pithy contrarian
- Morgan Housel — Storytelling clarity
- Hemingway — Raw simplicity

**Avoid:**
- Corporate jargon (leverage, synergize, circle back)
- Filler phrases (it's important to note, in order to)
- Passive voice when active works
- Em dashes — use periods instead

## Example Transformation

❌ **Weak:**
> After careful analysis of market conditions, taking into account various stakeholder perspectives, we've determined that a strategic pivot may be warranted.

✅ **Strong:**
> We need to pivot. The market shifted and our current approach isn't working.
