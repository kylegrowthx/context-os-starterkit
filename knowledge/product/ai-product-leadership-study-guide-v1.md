## Part 1: Foundations — What's Different About AI Products

### The Shift

AI isn't an incremental improvement to existing products. It's a fundamental shift in how software works.

Paul Adams (Intercom SVP Product) put it bluntly:

> "This is a meteor coming towards you. This is going to radically transform society. And I think if people don't explore AI properly, it will leave them behind."

Gustav Soderstrom (Spotify CPO) framed the historical context:

> "The internet started with curation, often user curation... then the world switched from curation to recommendation... And I think what we're entering now is we're going from curation to recommendation to generation. And I suspect it will be as big of a shift that you will eventually have to rethink your products."

### What Changes for Product Leaders

Traditional product management deals with deterministic software — the same input always produces the same output. AI products are probabilistic. The same input can produce different outputs. This changes everything about how you shape, spec, build, and evaluate.

**Five things that are fundamentally different:**

1. **Outputs are non-deterministic.** You can't write acceptance criteria the way you used to. "When user clicks X, show Y" doesn't work when the output varies every time.

2. **Context matters more than features.** Mike Krieger (Anthropic CPO) identified three parts of AI product utility: Model Intelligence + Context/Memory + Applications/UI. Product leaders increasingly shape context, not just interfaces.

3. **You ship to learn.** Nick Turley (OpenAI) on ChatGPT: "This is a pattern with AI — you won't know what to polish until after you ship."

4. **The bottleneck shifts.** When AI writes 90% of code (as at Anthropic), the bottleneck moves from engineering speed to decision-making quality. Strategy and clarity become the constraint, not development velocity.

5. **Evaluation is the new testing.** Traditional QA tests pass/fail criteria. AI products require evaluation frameworks (evals) that measure quality on spectrums. As Chip Huyen said: "Eval is really, really fun because it's extremely creative."

### Common Misconceptions

**"AI will replace product managers."** No. But AI will change what product managers do. Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly CPO): "Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably."

**"We need an AI team."** No. Paul Adams: "Don't bolt it on. Don't be like, 'Oh, we'll have a bunch of AI people...' We're trying to have everyone learn about it." Embed AI across teams, don't create a separate AI team.

**"More engineers = more output."** Not anymore. Scott Wu (Cognition CEO) invoked the Jevons Paradox: "I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now. Programming is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful." The form factor changes, but the skill becomes more valuable.

**"Start with AI, then find the problem."** Backwards. Marily Nika (Google/Meta AI PM): "Don't do AI for the sake of doing AI. Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way."

## Part 2: Understanding the Space — The AI Landscape for Product Leaders

### Foundation Models: What You Need to Know

You don't need to train models. You need to make informed decisions about which ones to use and how.

**Key models and their tradeoffs (2025-2026):**

| Model Family | Strengths | Best For | Tradeoffs |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| GPT-4/5 (OpenAI) | Intelligence, creativity, coding | Complex multi-step tasks, general purpose | Cost, rate limits |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Safety, long context, instruction following | Enterprise workflows, detailed analysis | Slower on some tasks |
| Gemini (Google) | Multimodal, fast, large context | Real-time applications, multimodal products | Ecosystem lock-in |
| Llama (Meta) | Open-source, customizable | On-premise, privacy-sensitive, custom fine-tuning | Requires infrastructure |
| Mistral | Performance per cost, open weights | Cost-sensitive production, European compliance | Smaller ecosystem |

**The decisions that matter:**

1. **Build vs. buy vs. integrate.** Build when AI is your core differentiator. Buy for commoditized AI (OCR, basic summarization). Integrate (combine APIs with your own orchestration) for most B2B use cases.

2. **Model selection.** Match model to use case. Don't default to the most powerful model — a smaller, faster model often wins on cost and latency for specific tasks.

3. **Cost structure.** AI APIs charge per token (input and output separately). Costs vary 10-100x between model tiers. Budget for AI compute as a variable cost, not a fixed one.

4. **Latency.** Users expect sub-second responses for inline suggestions, 2-5 seconds for chat, longer for complex analysis. Model size, proximity to data, and batching all affect latency.

### The Capabilities Frontier

The frontier moves fast. Logan Kilpatrick (Google DeepMind): "Build towards a GPT-5 future, not based on limitations of GPT-4 today."

Tamar Yehoshua (Glean President) added the corollary: "Build your differentiator around something that will continue to be there as the LLMs get better." Don't build workarounds for current model limitations — those get solved. Build on what gets better as models improve.

## Part 3: Shaping & Building — Product Development Process for AI

### Shape Up Applied to AI

Ryan Singer's Shape Up methodology is directly applicable to AI product development, perhaps more so than for traditional software. The core principles:

**1. Appetites Over Deadlines.** Set a time budget first ("we'll spend 4 weeks on this"), then shape scope to fit. This is critical for AI features where you can't predict exactly what you'll discover.

**2. Fixed Time, Variable Scope.** Six weeks maximum before you ship or kill. With AI features, scope naturally varies because model performance surprises you — sometimes better, sometimes worse than expected.

**3. Shape Before You Build.** Collaborative sessions where product, design, and engineering surface unknowns together. For AI, this means testing model capabilities during shaping, not after committing to build.

From GrowthX's internal shaping sessions with Ryan Singer:

> "We are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning."

The critical adaptation for AI: **bring model testing into shaping.** Before committing a 4-week cycle, run experiments to understand what the AI can and can't do. Shape your scope to what's reliably achievable.

### Continuous Calibration / Continuous Development (CC/CD)

Traditional CI/CD focuses on code correctness. AI products need CC/CD — Continuous Calibration alongside Continuous Development.

**What this means in practice:**

- Ship AI features knowing they'll need calibration
- Build monitoring from day one (not after launch)
- Set up feedback loops that improve AI behavior over time
- Plan for ongoing tuning, not just initial launch

### Writing Specs for AI Features

Traditional specs don't work for AI. You can't write "when user does X, show Y" when outputs are probabilistic.

**What works instead:**

1. **Define the problem and success criteria, not the exact output.** "Users should find relevant documents in under 5 seconds" not "return these specific documents."

2. **Specify boundaries and failure modes.** What should never happen? What are acceptable errors?

3. **Design evals alongside specs.** How will you measure if it's working? Define this before building.

4. **Plan for iteration.** The first version won't be right. Budget for 2-3 rounds of calibration.

### How Internal Work Changes

From Ryan Singer's GrowthX shaping sessions, a principle that applies broadly:

> "Good software is like a good stove. You see four burners, you see four knobs, and the knobs are in the same position relative to each other as the burners. You don't even think."

For AI products: the interface should mirror the actual workflow. Separate linear work (well-defined tasks) from non-linear work (exploration, experimentation). Don't force AI-driven discovery into linear pipelines.

**Key shaping insight: "Nail the daily visit."**

> "If we nail that one screen that if you don't log in every day, you feel really bad — then everything else can build from there."

Build the thing people should check every day first. Then expand from there.

## Part 4: Context Engineering — The New Core Skill

### From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering

"Prompt engineering" was the 2023 buzzword. It's already outdated. The real skill is **context engineering** — designing the full system of information that an AI model uses to produce useful outputs.

Logan Kilpatrick (Google DeepMind) was emphatic:

> "Context is all you need. Context is the only thing that matters. It's such an important piece of getting a language model to do anything for you."

Mike Krieger (Anthropic CPO) framed the product implications:

> "For utility of AI products, it's three part. One is model intelligence, the second part is context and memory, and the third part is applications and UI — and you need all three of those to converge."

### What Product Leaders Need to Understand

**Context engineering is a system design discipline, not a writing exercise.** It includes:

1. **System prompts** — The instructions that shape AI behavior across all interactions
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — Connecting AI to your product's data so it can reference real information
3. **Tool use** — Enabling AI to take actions (search, calculate, create) not just generate text
4. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Standardized way to give AI models access to tools and data (emerging standard from Anthropic)
5. **Memory** — Enabling AI to remember previous interactions and user preferences

**The product decisions this affects:**

- What information should the AI have access to?
- What actions should the AI be able to take?
- How do you keep context fresh and relevant?
- What's the right balance of autonomy vs. control?
- How do you handle context that's too large for the model's window?

### Practical Product Implications

**Data preparation > model selection.** Chip Huyen: "The biggest performance improvements in RAG solutions come from better data preparation, not agonizing over what vector databases to use."

**Context shapes quality.** Tomer Cohen (LinkedIn CPO) used a chef analogy: "You don't control the experience anymore, you control the ingredients. Give me the ingredients, give me the guidelines of how you cook, and now I'll take care of it."

**Context engineering is the moat.** Harrison Chase (LangChain CEO) has argued that the quality of context — how you curate, structure, and deliver information to models — is what differentiates AI products. Models are commoditizing. Context is not.

## Part 5: Evaluation & Quality — How to Know If It's Working

### Why Evaluation Is Different

Traditional QA: does the feature work as specified? Binary pass/fail.

AI evaluation: how good is the output? On what dimensions? For which users? It's a spectrum, and it requires creativity.

Chip Huyen on why evals matter: "If you talk to the users who understand what they want or they don't want, look into the feedback, then you can actually improve the application way, way, way more."

### The Evaluation Stack for Product Leaders

**Pre-launch evaluation:**
- Automated single-turn and multi-turn tests
- Multiple trials per test (outputs vary)
- Code-based, model-based, and human graders
- Edge case and adversarial testing

**Post-launch monitoring:**
- Distribution drift detection
- User feedback integration
- Quality regression tracking
- A/B testing for AI improvements
- Continuous benchmarking against baselines

### Designing for Uncertainty

Gustav Soderstrom (Spotify CPO) introduced the concept of **fault-tolerant user interfaces:**

> "You need to understand the performance of your machine learning to design for it. It needs to be fault tolerant and often you need an escape hatch for the user."

**Practical example:** If your AI gets it right 1 in 4 times, show 4 options (like Midjourney). If it's right 9 in 10 times, show one option with an easy edit.

Noah Weiss (Slack CPO) added the trust dimension:

> "The promise of the UI has to match the quality of the underlying data... I think this is actually one of the failings of the various LMs right now — they all appear supremely confident even when they're completely hallucinating."

**Don't make AI appear more confident than it is.** Design UI that communicates uncertainty honestly.

## Part 6: Audience & Go-to-Market — Positioning AI Features

### Headline vs. Invisible

**Make AI the headline when:**
- It delivers a transformative new capability (GitHub Copilot)
- It's the core product value proposition (ChatGPT, Cursor)
- Your audience is AI-forward and values AI explicitly

**Keep AI invisible when:**
- It enhances existing workflows (Notion AI, Linear)
- Trust and reliability matter more than novelty
- The AI augments human work rather than replacing it

### Pricing AI Features

Three models emerging in B2B:

| Model | When to Use | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Included in base** | AI is table stakes, not differentiator | Linear, many SaaS products |
| **Premium tier** | AI features are the upgrade reason | Notion AI, GitHub Copilot |
| **Consumption-based** | Usage varies widely across customers | OpenAI API, cloud AI services |

### Managing Expectations

Tamar Yehoshua (Glean President): "AI, we are underestimating how much it's going to change how we work. It's not going to be sudden from today to tomorrow because people haven't figured it out yet. But the people who have are going to be so far ahead."

**Honest communication builds trust.** Overpromisinng AI capabilities damages credibility. Frame AI as a tool with boundaries. Provide clear disclaimers. Educate users on what to expect.

**Handle "just add AI" pressure** by evaluating operational costs, staffing needs, and strategic fit before adoption. Educate executives on realistic AI benefits. Align AI initiatives with business goals, not hype cycles.

## Part 7: Skills & Practice — How to Get Good

### The 10 Skills That Matter Most

Ranked by how frequently they appeared across 18 podcast episodes and 7 research reports:

1. **Deep AI understanding** — Know how models work, what they can/can't do, where they're heading. Not engineering-level depth, but enough to make informed product decisions.

2. **Comfort with uncertainty** — Non-deterministic outputs, probabilistic thinking, building for ambiguity.

3. **Context engineering** — Designing the information architecture that makes AI useful.

4. **Clear outcome definition** — Precise specs for what AI should achieve, not how.

5. **Systems thinking** — Designing workflows and feedback loops, not just features.

6. **Daily AI usage** — Building intuition through constant practice with AI tools.

7. **Writing** — Highest leverage skill for scaling influence and defining AI behavior.

8. **Evaluation design** — Building creative, meaningful ways to assess AI quality.

9. **Architectural thinking** — Problem definition, tradeoff analysis, build/buy decisions.

10. **Cross-functional collaboration** — Bridging product, engineering, design, and research.

### What to Practice

**Weekly habits:**
- Use AI tools for your actual work (not just experimenting)
- Read one long-form piece on AI product development
- Do an AI product teardown (how did they design this? what context are they using?)

**Monthly projects:**
- Build something small with an AI API (even if you're not technical)
- Run an informal eval on an AI product you use
- Have a deep technical conversation with your AI/ML engineers

**Quarterly investments:**
- Read one book from the reading list
- Listen to 3-4 podcast episodes from Appendix D
- Attend one AI product event or meetup

### How to Stay Current Without Drowning

Chip Huyen challenged the common anxiety:

> "A question that gets asked a lot is, 'How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?' Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news? If you talk to the users who understand what they want or they don't want, look into the feedback, then you can actually improve the application way, way, way more."

**The reading stack (30 minutes/week):**
- **Lenny's Newsletter** — Product lens on AI
- **Latent Space** — AI engineering with product context
- **Simon Willison's Weblog** — Practical AI experiments daily
- **One Useful Thing** (Ethan Mollick) — AI adoption and organizational implications

**The podcast rotation (1-2 episodes/week):**
- **Lenny's Podcast** — AI product leader interviews
- **Latent Space Podcast** — AI engineering deep dives
- **The Cognitive Revolution** — Broad AI capabilities coverage

### How to Know You're Improving

- You can evaluate an AI feature proposal and immediately identify the key risks
- You have opinions on model selection for different use cases
- You can design an evaluation framework for a new AI feature
- You can explain context engineering to a non-technical executive
- You default to "what should the AI know?" before "what should the UI look like?"
- Your engineering team seeks your input on AI product decisions, not just design

## The Bottom Line

The product leaders who win in AI aren't the ones who understand models the deepest. They're the ones who understand what's different about building with AI and adapt their craft accordingly.

Five things to internalize:

1. **Context > Model.** The quality of information you give AI matters more than which model you use. Master context engineering.

2. **Shape before you build.** AI features are uncertain by nature. Use Shape Up to de-risk before committing cycles.

3. **Design for uncertainty.** Build fault-tolerant UIs. Don't make AI appear more confident than it is. Give users escape hatches.

4. **Ship to learn.** You won't know what to polish until after you ship. Plan for calibration, not perfection.

5. **Use AI daily.** You can't lead what you don't understand. Build intuition through practice, not just reading.

The space is moving fast. But the fundamentals of great product leadership — clear thinking, customer obsession, strong writing, decisive action — matter more than ever. AI just raises the stakes.
