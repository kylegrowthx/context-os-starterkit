> Everything GrowthX knows about Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), AI visibility, brand mentions in AI responses, prompt tracking methodology, and measurement frameworks -- consolidated in one place.

This directory contains the core knowledge base for AEO strategy, methodology, and research. It is organized into **guides** (actionable playbooks and study guides) and **research** (deep research, methodology documentation, and research notes). Related documents that live elsewhere in the project (product docs, competitive intel, client work, strategy) are cross-referenced below.
