# Context OS — Agent Configuration

<!-- TEMPLATE: Replace [YOUR COMPANY] and [BRACKETED] placeholders. Delete this comment when done. -->

## Project Overview

This is a structured knowledge base for [YOUR COMPANY]. It is not a codebase — there is no app, no build step, no dependencies. The product is context.

AI agents use this repository to understand the company, write in its voice, make decisions using executive personas, and produce on-brand work.

## Project Structure

├── pipeline/          Work management (research → scratchpad → outputs)
├── records/           Historical archives (search only, never bulk-load)
├── sources/           Trusted people and sources indexes

## Conventions

- **File naming**: `descriptive-name-v1.md` (lowercase, hyphens, version suffix)
- **Versioning**: Minor updates edit in place. Major changes create `-v2`, old goes to `/archive`
- **Navigation**: Every directory has `README.md` (overview) and `INDEX.md` (file listing with summaries)
- **Metadata**: Every content file uses `<metadata>` tags with: purpose, audience, summary, domain, confidence, context_tier, last_updated
- **Pipeline flow**: research/ → scratchpad/ → outputs/ (forward only, never backward)
- **Records**: Search only — never bulk-load transcripts, customers, or downloads
- **Research tasks follow the pipeline**: When asked to research any topic: (1) ask if the user wants raw research only or a full study guide, clarify scope and audience; (2) present a research plan with questions and output locations, get approval before starting; (3) save raw research to `pipeline/research/`, then if doing full study guide continue to `pipeline/scratchpad/` then `knowledge/`. Never skip steps. Load `agent-docs/research-agent.md` for full instructions.

## Context Loading Rules

1. Start with `CLAUDE.md` (always loaded automatically)
2. Load the task-specific agent config from `agent-docs/` based on what you're doing
3. Load context files referenced by the agent config
4. Load additional docs as needed — one file at a time, never entire directories
5. Newer docs win when information conflicts
